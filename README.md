# CANTEMIST-Participation
Code relative to the participation of the HULAT-UC3M team in the [CANTEMIST-CANcer TExt Mining Shared Task â€“ tumor named entity recognition](https://temu.bsc.es/cantemist/).

## CANTEMIST-NER
We used a deep learning architecture for the identification of named tumor morphology entities.  The architecture consists of convolutional and bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory layers and a final layer based on ConditionalRandom Field.

The developed code is [here](https://github.com/ssantamaria94/CANTEMIST-Participation/blob/master/final-model.ipynb)

During our participation, we developed a dictionary with the [National Cancer Institute's dictionary](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/diccionario) terminology to be used together with [Meaning Cloud](https://www.meaningcloud.com/). You can find it [here](https://github.com/ssantamaria94/CANTEMIST-Participation/blob/master/MeaningCloud_Dictionarie/basic_cancer_INC_es.tsv).
